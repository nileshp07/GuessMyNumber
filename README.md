# Guess My Number

## React Native Expo app

A simple app with three screens (StartGameScreen, GameScreen and EndGameScreen) where user puts a number between 1-100 and lets the phone (computer) guess that number.

Each guess is logged on the GameScreen with its number (order) and once the phone guesses the correct number, EndGameScreen is shown with the actual number and the number of guess it took to guess it with a Start New Game button which resets the game.
